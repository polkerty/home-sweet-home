This app helps solve two problems in my house:
   1) Task management - what to do, when?
   2) Inventory management - what do I have, where does it go, how to maintain it?


Our inventory is just a list of items. Each item has
a location, and optionally a restocking schedule and/or a maintenance
schedule. 

Schedules generate tasks - an assignment that goes onto our task board.b
Tasks can be generated in a number of ways:

   * Manually enter the task
   * Set up an 'automaton' that generates tasks on a schedule.
   * Configure a maintenance or restocking schedule for a particular piece of inventory.
